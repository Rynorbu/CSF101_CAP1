## Facebook Automation Script
### Overview
This script automates the process of logging into Facebook, navigating to a specific Facebook group, and scrolling through posts using Selenium WebDriver.

## Usage
1. Open the Automation.py script.
   
2. Replace the placeholder values with your Facebook credentials:
* username_field.send_keys("your_email_or_phone")
* password_field.send_keys("your_password")
  
3. Run the script with the following command:
* python3 Automation.py

## Configuration
The script is configured to scroll through posts 10 times. You can adjust the number of scrolls by modifying the for loop in the script:

* for i in range(10):  # Adjust this number as needed
  
The script waits 10 seconds between scrolls to allow the page to load. You can adjust this delay by modifying the time.sleep(10) line.
## Security
Do not hardcode your Facebook credentials in the script. For security, consider using environment variables or a more secure method to handle sensitive information.
